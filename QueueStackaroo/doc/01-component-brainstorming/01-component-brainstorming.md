## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

1. (3 points) Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. (3 points) Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. (4 points) Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

## Pre-Assignment

> Before you jump in, we want you to take a moment to share your interests
> below. Use this space to talk about your career goals as well as your personal
> hobbies. These will help you clarify your values before you start
> brainstorming. Plus it helps us get to know you better! Feel free to share
> images in this section.

For my career goals, I'm really not sure exactly where I want to go. When I was in high school I took a coding class and since then I really enjoyed the process of solving problems using code. This is what led me to CS in the first place and I just wanted to see where it could take me. Recently, I've been trying to learn some different languages and trying out some AI/Deep-learning just to explore my options.
As for some outside interests, I enjoy video games, cooking, splitting wood, driving, watching shows/anime, music production/DJ, and sports (mainly football). All three of the last interests or fairly newer interests and a project could help build my knowledge in these areas. Like for example I want to get into fantasy but I don't know much about it so maybe a fantasy component would be cool.

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided some example components that may
help you in your brainstorming. These components are organized by CSE
specializations.

- Artificial Intelligence
  - Artificial Neuron
  - Activation Function
  - Graphs
  - Search
- Computer Graphics and Game Design
  - Pixel
  - Polygon
  - Geometry
  - Pathing
- Database Systems and Data Analytics
  - Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
  - Any Data Model
  - Scraping
  - Data Mining
- Information and Computation Assurance
  - Password Hashing
- Computer Networking
  - Packet
  - MAC Address
  - IP Address
- Computer Systems
  - Complex Logic Gate
  - Semiconductor
- Software Engineering
  - Unit Testing
  - Performance Testing
- Individualized Option (e.g., X + CS)
  - Mathematical Matrix
  - Music Playlist

There is no requirement that you make use of any of the subdisciplines above.
If you want to model something from the real-world, go for it! Very common early
object projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

With all that in mind, here's an example component you can use for reference.
Feel free to use this example as the groundwork for your own components below.

- Example Component: `Point3D`
  - **Description**: The purpose of this component is to model a 3-dimensional point.
    Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that provides getters and
    setters for the three underyling coordinates. Then, we provide more complex
    mathematical operations in the secondary interface. It might be possible to
    create an immutable version of the class by removing the setters and instead
    having all secondary methods return new points. However, this design seems more
    inline with NaturalNumber.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `double getX()`: gets the x-coordinate of `this`
    - `double getY()`: gets the y-coordinate of `this`
    - `double getZ()`: gets the z-coordinate of `this`
    - `double setX(double x)`: sets the x-coordinate of `this`
    - `double setY(double y)`: sets the y-coordinate of `this`
    - `double setZ(double z)`: sets the z-coordinate of `this`
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void translate(double x, double y, double z)`: moves `this` by translating
      each coordinate by `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively
    - `void translate(Point3D p)`: moves `this` by treating `p` as a vector
    - `void move(double x, double y, double z)`: moves `this` by overwriting each
      coordinate with `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively
    - `void move(Point3D p)`: moves `this` to `p`
    - `double distance(Point3D p)`: gives the distance between `this` and `p`
    - `Point3D vectorTo(Point3D p)`: gives the vector from `this` to `p`
    - `boolean isOrigin()`: returns `true` if all three coordinates are zero

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for giving back the coordinates of the point. The secondary
methods use these getters and setters to perform more complex operations like
translating the point or computing the distance between two points.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `Point3D1L` class which layers the kernel on
top of the existing `Point` class in Java. It would also be reasonable to
implement `Point3D2` on top of three doubles and `Point3D3` on top of an array.
Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

**THIS IS ALOT AND PROBABLY WONT DO ALL BUT ITS JUST WHAT COULD BE
- Component Design #1: ArtificialNeuron
  - **Description**: The purpose of this component is to serve as a foundational building block for constructing more complex artificial neural networks and machine learning models. It models a single neuron, including weight initialization, output calculation, weight updates through training, and customization of activation functions. It also allows users to configure activation functions, select and customize learning algorithms, and visualize the training process and model behavior effectively.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `double calculateOutput(double[] inputs)`: Calculate the output of `this` based on `inputs` and an activation function
    - `double updateWeights(double[] gradients)`: Update the weights of input connections based on a learning algorithm
    - `double[] getWeights()`: Gets the current weights of `this`
    - `void setActivationFunction()`: Sets the activation function of `this`
    - `String getActivationFunction()`: Gets the activation function of `this`

- Component Design #2: QueueStackaroo
  - **Description**: The purpose of this component is to combine the functionality of a queue and a stack together and make it into one. However, the user does not have the choice as to when the data type will switch between a queue or a stack, it will be purely random. So it's made to piss you off.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void add(T x)`: Adds `x` to the end/top of `this`
    - `T remove()`: Removes and returns the front/top of `this`

    - `void flip()`: Reverses `this`. //MUST BE IN QUEUE MODE
    - `T next()`: Reports the front of `this`.
    - `T replaceNext()`: Replaces the front of this with `x`, and returns the old front.
    - `void rotate()`: Rotates `this`. //MUST BE IN QUEUE MODE
    - `void sort(Comparator<T> order)`: Sorts `this` according to the ordering provided by the compare method from `order`. //MUST BE IN QUEUE MODE
    - `void gamble()`: Allows you to switch to the other implementation but with a 30% chance all data is lost.

- Component Design #3: DJ/MusicCompositonComponent

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).

I'm sure it would have been different if this was a normal semester and your life wasn't super busy but I was a little lost on where to start at first. Like I wasn't exactly sure what the components should look like, how basic they should be, or really what I could model. The example did help though.

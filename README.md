# QueueStackaroo

The purpose of this project was just to get my foot in the door and create a goofy (shitpost) project 
with the skills that I have learned. This component mixes both queues and stacks into one data structure
by having a feature that switches between the functionality of the two. However, the user does not have
control over when it switches, as it randomly switches as it get's used. It's not a fair component, and 
it lowkey sucks to use, but it was fun to make.

#### What's in here

The main three files to worry about are the doc, src, and testing folders. The doc holds all the 
implementation details, including all the decisions that led me here. The src folder contains all of the 
interfaces and code for the component. The src folder also houses example of how this component could be 
used. The testing folder has all the testing for the standard, kernel, and secondary methods for the 
component.

# QueueStackaroo

The purpose of this project was just to get my foot in the door and create a goofy (shitpost) project 
with the skills that I have learned. This component mixes both queues and stacks into one data structure
by having a feature that switches between the functionality of the two. However, the user does not have
control over when it switches, as it randomly switches as it get's used. It's not a fair component, and 
it lowkey sucks to use, but it was fun to make.
